# Sarcastic Detection in Headline News Using Deep Learning
## Problem Statement
In today's digital age, distinguishing between sincere news headlines and those laden with sarcasm can be quite challenging. Imagine, for instance, mistaking a sarcastic headline for a legitimate news article or, worse yet, a hoax. It's disconcerting to learn that some organizations combat this issue by employing a sizable workforce of 250 individuals working in three shifts, tirelessly sifting through online news to determine whether a story is a hoax or not. This approach appears antiquated and inefficient in an era marked by digitization.

In reality, a well-structured team comprising data engineers, data scientists/machine learning engineers, and backend engineers—comprising perhaps 10 to 20 individuals—could accomplish the same task more effectively. This project aims to exemplify how machine learning can revolutionize this process, rendering it both efficient and automated. The proposed solution will only require occasional monitoring for model drift, periodic model retraining, and the execution of inference operations.

With access to a dataset from a previous project (where headlines were sarcastic rather than deceitful), it became apparent that employing natural language processing (NLP) techniques could significantly expedite the process and enhance overall efficiency.


## Project Objective
Develop a model capable of identifying sarcasm within news headlines.
